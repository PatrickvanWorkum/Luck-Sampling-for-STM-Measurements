## Lucky Sampling in STM measurement

Contains the code used in a project working with Prof. Dr. Fabian Nattere, focused around applying lucky sampling to STM measurement data.

The major takeaways:

- Using color mapping based on the mean Â± 3 standard deviations is the most effective approach.
- The median and adjustments to the standard deviation have no noticeable impact on the results. 
- The Root Mean Squared (RMS) provides a different perspective compared to the mean or median
- Important information is not encoded in periodic points but rather across a given time spread, however further investigation into this is needed.
- It may be possible to reduce the time spent on each pixel by up to 75%, depending on the variation in the time spread. One would want to conmplete analysis on another propers running for longer and shorter times.
- Work to better numerically compare the results; one, would want to look at matching 2D FT features across the spectrums to see. The removal of background noise may help with this
