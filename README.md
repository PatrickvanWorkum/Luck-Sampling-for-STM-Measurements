# Harmonic-Analysis

Contains the code used in a project working with Prof. Dr. Fabian Nattere, focused around applying lucky sampling to STM measurement data.

The major takeaways:

Using color mapping based on the mean Â± 3 standard deviations is the most effective approach.
The median and adjustments to the standard deviation have no noticeable impact on the results. 
The Root Mean Squared (RMS) provides a different perspective compared to the mean or median
Important information is not encoded in periodic points but rather across a given time spread, however further investigation into this is needed.
It may be possible to reduce the time spent on each pixel by up to 75%, depending on the variation in the time spread.
Work to better numerically compare the results.
